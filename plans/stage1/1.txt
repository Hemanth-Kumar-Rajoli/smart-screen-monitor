step 1:
    build basic media player it has operations as follows
    -> play and pause
    -> forward and backward

    note: we can mannage sound by system sound rather than coding for that
step 2:
    recognition of requirements such as
    -> face and hand

    note: we need to improve efficency of recognition
setp 3:
    recognize hand motions
    -> five fingers hold ==> pause
    -> five fingers open with no movement ==> play
    -> moving hand up ==> raise the system volume
    -> movin hand down ==> decrease the system volume
    -> moving hand forward ==> skip part of the video 
    -> moving hand backward ==> backward part of the video

    note: up to now we just assgin skip/backward to 3 minutes of video up on hand movement
step 4:
    synchronize above steps
